# Introduction
Sophia is a competitve open source tactical first person shooter, built on the open source Godot Engine.

# Game Principle
The main competitive game will consist of a 5v5 round based game mode. The goal of the attacking team is to plant a bomb on a dedicated bomb side that the defending team has to protect. The attacker team wins, when the bomb has exploded. Every round has a time limit of about 2 minutes. If the attacking team is not able to plant the bomb, the defending team has automatically won. In addition you can elimiate the entire enemy team to win the round. Based on your weapon, win streak, and fulfilled objectives, you get a certain amount of income. One team has won the match, if it has won 10 rounds overall.
